# HospitalSystem
The hospital system on java made as an activity for a University.

Code is already compiled technically, and can be ran just through terminal, though if necesarry, you can compile it through: javac hospitalsys.java
and run through: java hospitalsys.Main

Functionality:
- Multiple roles saved to internal database, can be replaced and edited to add new users and managers
- Permission system, that doesn't give access to certain roles that shouldn't have it (Such as patient unable to mark a surgery for himself)
- Simple UI
- Choice system using Scanner
- Arraylist to create list of users
- Authentification system
- Procedure management system
